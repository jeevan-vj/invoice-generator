Here's a comprehensive implementation plan for adding new features to the dashboard:

1. **Layout Structure Setup**
   - Create a new layout file at `app/dashboard/[feature]/layout.tsx`
   - Import and use the shared dashboard layout component
   - This ensures consistent navigation and styling across all dashboard features

2. **Navigation Integration**
   - Add new navigation items to `components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`
   - Follow the existing pattern:
     - Group related items under a section header
     - Use appropriate icons from `lucide-react`
     - Maintain consistent URL structure: `/dashboard/[feature]/[action]`
   - Remove any placeholder or unused navigation items

3. **Feature Organization**
   - Create feature-specific directories:
     ```
     app/
     ├── dashboard/
     │   └── [feature]/
     │       ├── layout.tsx
     │       ├── page.tsx (main list view)
     │       ├── new/
     │       │   └── page.tsx (create form)
     │       └── [id]/
     │           ├── page.tsx (details view)
     │           └── edit/
     │               └── page.tsx (edit form)
     ```

4. **Component Structure**
   - Create reusable components in `app/components/dashboard/[feature]/`
   - Follow naming conventions:
     - `[feature]-list.tsx` for list views
     - `[feature]-form.tsx` for create/edit forms
     - `[feature]-card.tsx` for individual item displays

5. **Data Management**
   - Create mock API in `app/api/mocks/[feature].ts`
   - Define TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas
   - Implement CRUD operations with simulated delays
   - Follow existing patterns for error handling and loading states

6. **UI/UX Consistency**
   - Use shared UI components from `components/ui/`
   - Maintain consistent spacing and layout
   - Follow the established dark mode support
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness
   - Use consistent form patterns and validation

7. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks for local state
   - Implement loading states
   - Handle error states with toast notifications
   - Use URL parameters for filtering and sorting

8. **Testing Considerations**
   - Plan for component testing
   - Consider edge cases and error states
   - Test responsive behavior
   - Verify dark mode compatibility

9. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
   - Document any new interfaces or types
   - Update README if necessary

10. **Performance Optimization**
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Use appropriate data fetching patterns
    - Optimize re-renders
    - Consider pagination for large datasets

11. **Accessibility**
    - Use semantic HTML
    - Include proper ARIA labels
    - Ensure keyboard navigation
    - Test with screen readers

12. **Security Considerations**
    - Validate all user inputs
    - Sanitize data before display
    - Handle sensitive information appropriately
    - Implement proper access controls

This plan can be adapted for any new feature while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase structure and patterns.
